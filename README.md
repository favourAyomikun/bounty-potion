# Bounty Potion

A web application deployed on Vercel: [Bounty Potion](https://bounty-potion-l962.vercel.app/).

## üé® Design Decisions

- **Next.js Framework**: Chosen for its SSR and static generation capabilities, improving SEO and performance.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling to maintain a consistent and scalable design system.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Ensures reusability and maintainability of UI elements.
- **Vercel Deployment**: Provides seamless CI/CD integration with GitHub, ensuring quick updates and rollbacks.

## üîç Assumptions

- Users will access the application from modern web browsers.
- The project requires minimal backend interactions, focusing on a frontend-driven approach.
- The deployment process should be simple and automated using Vercel.
