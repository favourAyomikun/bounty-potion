# Bounty Potion

A web application deployed on Vercel: [Bounty Potion](https://bounty-potion-l962.vercel.app/).

## üé® Design Decisions

- **React.js with Vite**: Chosen for its fast development environment and optimized production builds, ensuring a smooth developer experience and great performance.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling to maintain a consistent and scalable design system.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Ensures reusability and maintainability of UI elements.
- **Vercel Deployment**: Provides seamless CI/CD integration with GitHub, ensuring quick updates and rollbacks.

## üîç Assumptions
